# Dexterous

Dexterous is a Web application targeted towards people who are exploring
into specialized fields of study or developing a particular skill set on
their own. It helps to organize their workflow through exploration tracks,
which are simply a sequence of milestones and associated learning resources.

Users are encouraged to share their exploration tracks with others to
facilitate collaborative learning. In this respect exploration tracks are
similar to courses but they are created by users themselves and fine tuned
as per their requirements and time-constraints.

It can be compared to various online learning platforms but the key difference
is that Dexterous is entirely decentralized. There are no distinctions
between educators and students and anyone can create their courses. There are
no degrees to be awarded, no pointless competition among participants and
no centralized syllabus or timeframe.

## Technicalities

Dexterous is a web application powered by Ruby on [Rails framework](http://rubyonrails.org/).

## Current state of progress

Dexterous is very much a work in progress. But the preliminary functionalities
are in place and goals are well defined. We welcome any contributions in form
of code, criticism or suggestions.
